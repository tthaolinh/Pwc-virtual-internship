# Task 3: Diversity and Inclusion
At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.
Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

#of men
#of women
#of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover 
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women
